    <h1>Ferreto Studios</h1>
    <p>Hello! This is <a title="Ferret's Corner" href="https://ferretosan.neocities.org/>Ferret</a> speaking. But, I really don't want to have to write six million lines of HTML code, so I'll keep it simple. Ferreto Studios is a group of programmers and gamers who might be addicted to their hobbies a little too much. Because it is owned by me, you <i>cannot</i> join. But, <a title="Ferret's Corner" href="https://ferretosan.neocities.org/>Ferret</a> out.</p>
